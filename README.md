# Team Planning

## Overview
Team planning is essential to your success as a developer. The following requirements will guide your planning process while at NSS.

- [Figma Mock](https://www.figma.com/file/NUGTGGsjuhazmwbF2DzfPA/Planning)
- [Project Board](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-13/team-planning/projects/1)

## Requirements when starting a project (BEFORE PLANNING)
- Create the Issue Template (ISSUE_TEMPLATE)
- Create the Pull Request Template (PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
- Codebase Setup (i.e. index.html, styles.css, main.js, etc)
- Ensure all team members have access to the repo and have it pulled down on their machines and the setup is running properly
- Update repo settings to require 2 reviewers and apply to admin
- Create a project board with automated kanban
- Create a figma board ensuring all your teammates have access to it (likely via email addresses)

## Requirements when planning (BEFORE DEV)
- Talk through the project requirements to ensure every understands the premise of the project
- Talk through the “user flow” of the project taking notes
- Create a Dependency Graph Ticket
- Create issue tickets that outline all the pertinent info based on your notes (you can divide an conquer on this, but if you do, your team MUST review all tickets together and all approve of them)

## Requirements during development
- Make sure code is properly formatted
- Make sure your code works and is tested before creating a PR
- Pull Requests will contain all of the information included on the PR ticket template. DO NOT APPROVE the PR if your teammate has not completed this
- Do NOT work someone else’s ticket unless you are pairing or working together
- Do NOT rewrite someone else’s code
- Do NOT work ahead of your teammates. It is better to help them so that everyone stays together than to “leave anyone behind”
- Do NOT add scope to a ticket that you have be assigned without team approval
- Have conversations and chat with your teammates to get to know them better
- Trust your teammates. You all belong here and can produce good code!
- Don’t be an asshole! Because they stink...

#### Follow the PR Review Process:
- Reference the issue you are resolving on the PR
- Removed all console logs and commented out code
- Assign team members to review
- Once it has been approved by 2 teammates, the person who created the PR merges it in.

##### By approving a teammates Pull Request, you are saying that you did the following:
- Fetched the teammates' branch to run locally on your machine
- Tested the code locally based on the PR instructions
- Looked at the code and ask questions using GH Review
- Approve the PR

**NOTE:**
Once code is merged to master, it is now the source of truth. 

Each team member will need to merge master into their own branches to continue to work, so you will want to make sure that your code works with the new changes.

## Requirements for finishing up your project
- All members are familiar with all aspects of the code
- You have reviewed how you will present your project to the class. EVERY team member will speak for 1 minute each and then answer class questions based on the feature they built.
#### README is completed with:
- Name of the Project
- Overview of the project
- Link to your wireframes/prototype
- Link to the deployed project (if applicable)
- Link to your project board (yes...even though it is a part of the repo)
- Description of the user
- List of features
- Screenshots of your project
- List of contributors and links to their GH profiles
